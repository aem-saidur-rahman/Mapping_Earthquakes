# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a map that tracks not only the earthquakes for the past 7 days, but the magnitude as well. The map also includes pop-up information for each incident.

## Project Overview

- Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.
- Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.
- Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.
- Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.
